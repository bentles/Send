# Send Game

A block-placing signal-processing game loosely based on minecraft and concepts from reactive extensions. Also my first ever proper F# program so it's probably kinda jank. For the moment I am building out some tutorial levels that introduce the concepts and then from there I will have to finally decide what this game is actually going to be. For now I'm having a lot of fun building everything.

Built with Xelmish by Chris Pritchard which lets you use the Elm architecture on top of MonoGame (replaced XNA) for game development.
